# Flipkart-Analysis-using-machine-learning
This is a machine learning project on analysis of a raw flipkart dataset, sourced from kaggle, for association rules and various patterns of its sales.
The pdf file may not be supported in many of the computers.
The folder flipkart project contains sub folders, with notebooks inside it. The raw data set is in the zip file named flipkart.zip in the same folder as the 'subfolders'.
The subfolders contains the names such as 
1. Cleaning- The raw data set has many discrepancies, and missing data, this was resolved in the notebooks.
2. Specification Keys and Values - There is a column, with the help of various cleaning cleaning techniques, the specification keys and values are extracted for further analysis.
3.Flipkart Advantage- this notebook basically predicts whether a given product is a fk advantage product or not, suing suitable learning models.
4. Discount vs Brand vs Category - This module is an analysis of the following columns present in the dataset.
5. Apriori Algorithm - This module basically uses apriori algorithm to get the association rules between the data sets.
